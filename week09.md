# Week 9 -- Introduction to Neural Networks

* In preparation for the next class, do the reading and familiarize 
yourself with the code in the related notebooks.
* Ideally, you will be able to run the notebooks listed below in Colab.
* There will be a quick quiz at the beginning of class on the video and reading.
